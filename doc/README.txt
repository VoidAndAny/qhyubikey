qhyubikey - YubiKey OTP extension for ezpublish

Overview:
=========
The purpose of this project is to provide support to YubiKey authentication for eZ Publish.
This in order to make eZ Publish authentication more secure either by:
 - replacing the standard password by the use of the One Time Password (OTP) generated by the YubiKey USB key.
   An OTP is a password that becomes invalid on the first use and gets invalidate if another OTP is generated from the same YubiKey.
 - adding a 2nd factor to eZ Publish authentication. In order to login, the user needs the both his password and the OTP from the authorized YubiKey. 

Yubico YubiKey:
===============
The YubiKey, manufactured by Yubico, is a device that acts as a USB keyboard and provides secure authentification by a one-time password algorithm

How it works:
=============
YubiKey OTP datatype:
=====================
A new datatype storing the OTP as data_text has been created. This allows the validation of the OTP string generated by the YubiKey at publishing time.
If the OTP string is not valid then it will trigger an error and invalidate the publishing process.

Custom templates:
=================
Customization of some login.tpl and edit.tpl files to add the YubiKey OTP field

Custom user/login view:
=======================
A new ybuser/login view script has been created. It will validate the YubiKey OTP submitted from the login screen and then call a custom
login handler to check if the user is allowed to login using YubiKey OTP:
 - no OTP submitted, assume that we are using standard single factor authentication using the password. If an OTP has been recorded for the user then deny
   the login process as we require the use of YubiKey to login. If no OTP has been recorded then use the "standard" login handler.
 - an OTP string has been submitted, check the validity. If not valid then deny login even if the password is correct. If valid then check if the YubiKey
   prefixes match and if the user have selected to use OTP as single factor or 2 factor authentication. For 2 factor auth, we will require the password
   to be valid by using the "standard" login handler.

Login Handler:
==============
A login handler has been created to check if a user is allowed to login with his YubiKey and that key is authorized.
In all situations, the ybuser/login view will call the login handler to process the login request. Depending on what the user has set in his profile
the user will be loggedin directly or will be processed by the "standard" login handler to verify his password.

Yubico PHP package:
===================
The YubiKey OTP is validated using the Yubico API client for PHP.
